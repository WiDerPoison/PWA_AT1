# PWA_AT1

Latest up dated 
This PWA is a basic study planner app which enables users to upload tasks and there due date into a database and comes with a built in meme gallery
in which the user can add their own images into. The font this app uses is spectralk as that is the personal perference of the creator, Isaac Rofe.

The roles of the different folders in this PWA are as follows

    PWA_AT1
        Acts as the container for the project

    node_modules
        Generated by npm it holds all the dependecies of the project, for more information you can follow this link here 
        https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs

    public
        Holds all the content that the front-end of the web server can see, housing the HTML CSS JS including all the different images and 

    DynamicAssests
        Holds all the moving content like the splash screen videos
    
    Fonts
        Holds all the spectral font files

    IconImages
        Holds all the icons used

    Uploads
        stores all the images in the meme gallery



What to install and how to install:

Firstly you will need to download node from https://nodejs.org/en make sure install the LTS version (long term support)
to verify the intsallation process run the commands 'node -v' and 'npm -v', if that is successful you should then download 
a code editor, I personally recommend VS code, https://code.visualstudio.com/download, but you can use whatever you feel like

Next you run the command npm init -y, which crates the package.json if not alrady created

You can then download sqlite from this site https://www.sqlite.org/download.html, once on it you will need to install sqlite-tools-win-x64-3470000 for windows, if you are using something different you will need to find or accomnying package

You will now need to run these consective commands to install all the option libraries 

    'npm install crypto'
    'npm install express'
    'npm install multer'
    'npm install sqlite3'

The reasons for downloads of each of the npm installs include:

Crypto - adds hashing funcitonality to the PWA mkaing it so duplicate images can be dedected as they have different file names

Express - is a crurical live server feature making things built in and run smoothly

Multer - is often used with express to simplify speciifc tasks like form data and such when uploading data like images

sqlite3 - helps run the form submsison for the study page as it uses SQL

With all these downloads the program should run. 

Thankyou for using my PWA
